# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-08-09

This is the repository's single global status file. Current task records belong in
[`status/active/`](status/active/); completed records belong in
[`status/archived/`](status/archived/).

## Purpose and current phase

This repository is the conservative, auditable source for Claude, Codex, and Reasonix skills
and selected project-local harness configuration. `skills-source/` is canonical; generated
runtime output is rebuilt, scanned for secrets, backed up, and deployed one skill directory at
a time. Whole-root mirroring is forbidden, unknown live skills are preserved by default, and
Codex `.system` is outside repository ownership.

The current phase is deletion-first simplification plus reliability hardening. The 2026-08-09
review removed duplicate, fixture-only, dependency-incomplete, and retired-platform features;
it also repaired the safe lifecycle for canonical skill deletion.

## Current skill inventory

| Scope | Canonical skills | Generated/live count |
|---|---:|---:|
| Shared | 7 | Claude 7, Codex 7, Reasonix 7 |
| Claude-only | 0 | 0 |
| Codex-only | 8 | Codex 8 |
| Reasonix-only | 0 | 0 |
| Unique union | 15 | Claude 7, Codex 15, Reasonix 7 |

Current canonical names:

- Shared: `brainstorming`, `git-review`, `paper-polish`, `subagent-driven-development`,
  `systematic-debugging`, `verification-before-completion`, `writing-plans`.
- Codex-only: `chatgpt-apps`, `cli-creator`, `coderabbit-review`, `define-goal`, `hatch-pet`,
  `security-best-practices`, `security-ownership-map`, `security-threat-model`.

Harness environment subsets are `minimal` 1/1/1, `work` 2/4/2, and `full` 7/15/7 for
Claude/Codex/Reasonix. All three definitions are valid and their current staging locks are valid.

## 2026-08-09 cleanup decisions

Eleven canonical skills were removed:

- Shared: `control-chrome`, `latex-tectonic`, `path-risk`, `placeholder-ok`, `writing-skills`.
- Claude-only: `codex-cli-runtime`, `codex-result-handling`, `gpt-5-4-prompting`.
- Codex-only: `codex-repo-maintainer`, `control-in-app-browser`, `google-drive-comments`.

Most were exact plugin duplicates, fake-home fixtures, incomplete local copies, or depended on
missing plugin runtime files. Removing `writing-skills` is an intentional capability reduction,
not a pure duplicate removal: its local copy depended on an unavailable Superpowers skill, while
Codex retains the platform `.system/skill-creator` path.

`code-review` became the narrower `coderabbit-review`. It now triggers only for an explicit
CodeRabbit request, never installs the CLI through `curl | sh`, requires installation approval,
and uses bounded waits compatible with normal progress updates. It remains in `full` and is not
part of `work`.

Additional repairs restored seven truncated skill descriptions, changed
`security-ownership-map` to resolve scripts from its actual skill root, and removed four
unreferenced academic/pressure-test documents from the deployed `systematic-debugging` tree.

## ArkCLI uninstall

ArkCLI 1.0.11's official `+connect uninstall` path was used; live directories were not hand
deleted. Seven detected agents resolved to five unique skill roots. The command removed 24
ArkCLI-managed skills from each of three populated roots (72 directory removals total); all five
roots then had no `ark-*`, `arkcli-*`, or `.arkcli-managed-skills.json` residue. Fifty-one
non-ArkCLI top-level entries were preserved. Codex `.system` and its marker were untouched.

## MCP and retired-platform scope

The repository MCP registration subsystem was retired. Its only template targeted the archived
`@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`, no profile actually consumed a template, and repository
status evidence showed no real MCP apply. The template, apply/helper scripts, MCP schemas/tests,
CLI route, profile/env coupling, and CI job were removed. This was scope pruning of an unused,
outdated capability; it was not a live MCP unregister, and no live Claude MCP configuration was
changed.

The env build evidence contract is now schema 2 and the env lock contract is schema 3. Obsolete
MCP count/hash fields were removed, while `TaskOverlayHash` and real Claude/Codex/Reasonix
`TaskOverlaySkills` evidence are schema-covered.

Remaining OpenClaw/OpenCode-only active specs, inventories, ignored manifests, and stale status
records were deleted or archived. Historical dated implementation plans remain historical. The
global `.gitignore` rules that hid all `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files were removed.

## Safe skill retirement

Deleting canonical source also removes its current managed-manifest entry. Previously, the old
live directory then became unknown and could not be safely pruned. `sync.ps1` now supports an
explicit external `-RetireManifestPath` for this one operation only.

The retirement path is fail-closed:

- strict JSON, safe lowercase names, exact per-platform targeting, and `.system` rejection;
- active generated/current-manifest/canonical names are rejected, including `reasonix-only`;
- both the supplied `RepoRoot` and the script's non-overridable repository root are canonical
  authorities, so env staging cannot bypass the check;
- the manifest path/bytes, canonical absence evidence, source/live roots, and target tree hashes
  are bound into sync-plan schema 2;
- saved plans self-validate before comparison, and Apply requires the unchanged reviewed plan;
- the exact Reasonix override root is included in backup;
- prune moves the target aside and re-hashes it before permanent deletion; missing, non-directory,
  or changed targets fail closed and changed directories are restored.

This mechanism does not maintain a replay-consumption ledger. Successful runs must delete their
external plan and retirement JSON after the backup journal has recorded the result.

## Current machine evidence

On `MAGINA-LAPTOP`, reviewed plan
`7883fbbc52bd4c259d455475d7e932a5097e59932d6d1d582eb7116bf61fd2a3` was applied on
2026-08-09. Backup:
`C:\Users\Magina\.ai-agent-dotfiles-backups\sync-backup-20260809-160759`.

Results:

- Claude: `+0 ~2 =5 -8`, final managed/live count 7.
- Codex: `+1 ~8 =6 -9`, final managed/live count 15; `coderabbit-review` added.
- Reasonix: `+0 ~2 =5 -5`, final managed/live count 7.
- All 22 explicit retirement targets are absent live, present in backup, and recorded once in the
  completed journal with `explicit-retirement` authority.
- Unknown live skills: 0 on all three platforms.
- Codex `.system`: marker present; its SHA-256 remained
  `48BC5A9203F5630594588311EB6DAB7CBE75A2636E5B41F01E11CAB7F35DC7B6`; six system skills remain.
- The external retirement JSON and reviewed plan were destroyed after verification.
- A subsequent ordinary sync dry-run (without retirement authority) reported Claude
  `+0 ~0 =7 -0`, Codex `+0 ~0 =15 -0`, and Reasonix `+0 ~0 =7 -0`, with zero unknowns.

After the cleanup verification, the user selected the smaller stock `work` environment. Reviewed
plan `6962e66c35c9380b7da746af478d6164c3ba165a32950e52c09928e6c61dace3` was applied through
`env activate work` at 2026-08-09 16:29 local time. Backup:
`C:\Users\Magina\.ai-agent-dotfiles-backups\sync-backup-20260809-162935`.

- Claude applied `+0 ~0 =2 -5`; final live set is `git-review` and `systematic-debugging`.
- Codex applied `+0 ~0 =4 -11`; final live set is `brainstorming`, `git-review`,
  `systematic-debugging`, and `writing-plans`.
- Reasonix applied `+0 ~0 =2 -5`; final live set is `git-review` and
  `systematic-debugging`.
- Task overlay additions remain empty for all three platforms. Environment lock and live parity
  pass, project `RequiredEnv=work` matches, unknown live skills are zero, and Codex `.system`
  remains present with the same marker SHA-256.

During pre-commit validation, adding a detached worktree for an exact staged-snapshot scan triggered
the repository's existing `post-checkout` hook and unexpectedly ran a full-manifest sync. The hook
created mandatory backup `sync-backup-20260809-164838`; no unknown skill or `.system` content was
lost. The machine was immediately restored through a hooks-disabled, fully scanned and reviewed
`env activate work` plan (`f08378a60b6efa7dfdcd06179124be4f21d0bc402078344c18c64ffac7c4019f`).
Recovery backup: `sync-backup-20260809-165216`. Immediately after recovery, main-repository status
again reported stock `work`, valid lock, live parity pass, zero task additions, zero unknowns, and
the unchanged `.system` marker hash. The temporary worktree was removed. Creating the cleanup commit
then correctly made the commit-bound staging locks stale; live remains the exact 2/4/2 `work` set and
live parity still passes.

This evidence applies only to `MAGINA-LAPTOP`. Other machines require their own reviewed dry-run;
auto-sync hooks never create or consume retirement authority.

## Validation status

The final local validation baseline is:

- build: Claude 7, Codex 15, Reasonix 7;
- exact cleanup-commit snapshot secret scan: no blocking findings; gitleaks found no leaks;
- `harness-env.tests.ps1`: 126 passed;
- `harness-profile.tests.ps1`: 34 passed;
- `harness-multiplatform.tests.ps1`: 17 passed;
- `task-skills.tests.ps1`: 23 passed;
- `agent-dotfiles.tests.ps1`: 11 passed;
- `skills-import.tests.ps1`: 21 passed;
- `config-sync.tests.ps1`: 17 passed;
- `sync.tests.ps1` and `doctor.tests.ps1`: PASS.

Independent reviews approved both the skill deletion/merge decisions and the MCP/retirement
implementation after their findings were fixed.

## Current boundaries and known state

- Machine-private `state/current-env.json` attests stock `work` with an empty task overlay. After the
  cleanup commit changed the repository commit identity, `env status` correctly reports all staging
  locks stale/invalid and activation attestation drift, while live parity still passes, `.system`
  remains present, and project `RequiredEnv=work` matches. Full-only canonical skills remain
  available for explicit task-overlay hot-plug; they are not part of the current live baseline.
- Project Harness Profiles remain project-local. They do not write global homes, install
  project-local skills, or switch global environments automatically.
- Codex `config.toml`, credentials, sessions, caches, and unrelated home configuration are outside
  this repository's sync scope.
- The MCP subsystem removal did not alter any live MCP registration.
- User-owned `.reasonix/desktop-topic-*.json` changes and the concurrent
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-live-safety-hardening-design.md` plus
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-09-live-safety-*.md` planning stream were not modified or included
  by this task. The main dirty-worktree scan currently flags a false positive where one excluded
  plan spells the tracked `task-skill-hotplug` filename; the exact cleanup-commit snapshot passes
  the unchanged scanner.
- Git publishing is outside this cleanup task: no push or pull request has been performed.

## Next actions

1. After the concurrent planning stream rewrites its false-positive path reference, run a reviewed
   `env activate work -DryRun` / `-Apply` from the main repository to refresh commit-bound staging
   and activation attestation; live is already the correct stock `work` set.
2. Revalidate other managed machines independently. For retired skills still present elsewhere,
   use a new machine-local retirement JSON and reviewed bound plan; do not reuse this machine's
   deleted authorization files.
