# Live Safety Hardening

Last updated: 2026-09-01

Status: In progress. Baseline-reconciliation Task 1 is complete (5/5), the Phase 0 entry-interlock
subplan is complete (43/43), and Phase 1 is complete (44/44). The corrected privacy rewrite is
published at `bbba28f`; GitHub Support ticket `#4697323` is resolved after server-side garbage
collection/cache clearing, and the 2026-08-27 old-SHA re-probe confirms the object is no longer served.
Phase 2 Task 1 Step 1 is complete (Task 1 1/6; Phase 2 overall 1/52), while Phases 3-4 have not
started.

Policy: `ProtocolVersion=3`, `ReleaseState=interlocked`.

## Completed evidence

- Phase 0: 43/43 checklist items complete; implementation commit `0a6c16e`.
- Phase 1: 44/44 checklist items complete.
- Phase 1 checkpoint unified validation: 31/31 suites passed with every error count zero; summary SHA-256
  `744f20d5f2155e0c0d6560c49c8f78e0fd86d95364b3048d4e3668f73214f82b`.
- Artifact validation: 19 contracts, 19 positive fixtures, 28 negative fixtures, 0 failures;
  summary SHA-256 `1304e114343120903fcaceec57ea80fa8ead77bd252ad6a609625bd2ce7216d2`.
- Build (Claude 7 / Codex 15 / Reasonix 7), secret scan, doctor, protected-path privacy test,
  diff checks, and sync DryRun passed without live mutation.
- Corrected history rewrite: fresh remote and local branch audits contain zero protected-path
  records and zero targeted STATUS matches; four local user-owned files remain present and ignored.
- GitHub Support closure: ticket `#4697323` is resolved after Support ran server-side garbage
  collection and cleared the repository cache. The independent old-SHA re-probe returned 404 for
  commit/tree/raw endpoints, 422 from the commits REST endpoint, and `upload-pack: not our ref` from
  a no-write direct-fetch dry run; local HEAD and refs remained unchanged.
- Phase 2 Task 1 intermediate read-only authority/schema slice: token/Known-Folder authority,
  no-follow metadata targets, root-claims v1, current-env-state v3, and exact-byte pair validation are
  implemented. Registered validation passed 21 positives and 66 negatives with zero failures; three
  independent authority/schema/fixture reviews passed after their findings were fixed.
- Phase 2 Task 1 sealed bootstrap/global-lock slice: an external bootstrap lock protects an exact
  six-directory plus final-lock prefix with atomic final ACLs; existing-only global acquisition,
  callback/opaque ACE rejection, two-repository zero-wait contention, test-only bounded wait,
  owner-death release, and all 14 before/after hard-kill boundaries pass. Independent security,
  concurrency-evidence, and scope reviews passed after their findings were fixed.
- Phase 2 Task 1 held-global-lock registry slice: pristine bootstrap and fixed post-bootstrap
  envelopes are separate, and a real typed global-lock witness guards a read-only unified view with
  strict in-memory zero-write validation of canonical/home claims, `VALID|MISSING|INVALID` state,
  represented-root conflicts, and unresolved normalized-UUID live markers. Tests cover typed-lock,
  zero-write, overlap, and hostile topology/type/reparse/hard-link/ADS/security cases.
- Phase 2 Task 1 caller-held canonical/current-route slice: exact canonical setup bytes and transaction
  evidence are sealed under the canonical lock; canonical-bound acquisition binds the genuine CLR
  owner in strict canonical-to-global order, and dependent locks release only tail-to-head. The
  read-only route-set capture revalidates held metadata, rejects stateful/ABA/ETS/foreign-owner
  substitution and drift, and closes private target/live-set/registry receipts through retryable
  `OPEN|CLOSING|CLOSED` states.
  Registry coverage is `HELD_METADATA_VERIFIED`; filesystem capability remains
  `UNPROBED_READ_ONLY`. Current-route overlap coverage is implemented without claiming the complete
  forbidden-root matrix or production integration.
- 2026-08-28 CI repair (infrastructure, no Task 1 step): the always-red `Validate` workflow was
  traced to elevated GitHub runner tokens creating `BUILTIN\Administrators`-owned objects while the
  current-user-only checks demanded the token user SID. Resolver version
  `windows-token-sid-current-user-only-v2` accepts owner evidence from {token user SID, token
  default owner} across canonical, home-authority, and registry checks; DACL current-user-only
  requirements are unchanged. The hard-kill suite self-seals its own bytes and the reviewed load;
  the repair re-pinned the reviewed-load manifest, actual-prelude rows and digest, pre-section
  region, transport-contract extent, function inventory, cleanup-gate self digest, and controller
  surface digest while the 299/81/2 sealed mutation inventory revalidated unchanged. Schemas and
  the three positive fixtures moved to v2. The parent-lease external-attack wait now exceeds the
  helper's own deadline so missed windows surface as explicit diagnostics. Local validation:
  syntax gate 156 files, artifact validation 21/21/66/0, targeted suites green (recovery 104/0
  including three new owner-rule assertions, command-result 46/0, registry/transaction/
  parent-lease/home-authority/live-concurrency pass), build 7/15/7, secret scan clean, sync
  DryRun without mutation. The definitive unified run passed all 34 suites exactly once with
  zero failures and timeouts (hard-kill 317/0 inside the run); external create-new summary
  SHA-256 `fef5a8e1d1ed5acd5a1bf74c8b7290b19a06aceb043f4ad5452f5735d5a396fa`. The follow-up CI
  run for `6540681` then completed green with 34/34 and hard-kill 317/0 on the runner, closing
  the failure streak since 2026-08-09. Production Apply remains interlocked.
- Phase 2 fourth-checkpoint unified validation: all 34 suites were discovered and passed exactly
  once with every runner error count zero; external create-new summary raw SHA-256
  `b8bc1c887ea1d8aaf9cffbc2ef63ded74779ea430920a117a377b695d21710ec` and independently recomputed
  discovery SHA-256
  `1c323da6ae6872e58d8a0cf9af3c6d15ef9c0b9130fbfdc178f73602f69500b0`. The hard-kill suite reached
  317/0 and the registry suite emitted 159 PASS assertions with exit code 0. Build (7/15/7), secret
  scan, and sync DryRun passed without production Apply, live-root mutation, Git index/ref mutation,
  or new hard-kill temporary-directory residue.

- Phase 2 Task 1 Step 1 failure-matrix completion (2026-08-29, test-only): the remaining
  identity/concurrency failure cases were written with no production script change. Registry tests
  now cover a tracked working tree/GitCommonDir inside a live target root, second-repository claims
  nested in and exactly duplicating an existing recovery root, linked-worktree versus second-clone
  identity and lock namespaces, two-HomeRoot ancestor/descendant overlap, and enumerated rejection of
  public `-HomeRoot`/`-BackupRoot`/`-LockWaitSeconds`/`-TestMode` on the registry command surface.
  Home-authority tests add the exhaustive six-pair state-semantics platform-overlap matrix, per-root
  incremental absent-to-created classification, and the same parameter enumeration across
  authority/lock/bootstrap/live-target commands. Live-concurrency adds a `canonical-global-hold`
  host operation proving a canonical-bound global holder beats live-route and second-repository
  canonical contenders with exact zero-wait busy, zero writes, correct canonical-before-global order,
  and post-release witness re-acquisition; adopt/retirement races are covered at the implemented
  lock-class level pending the Step 5 retrofit. Focused suites passed (191/197/222 PASS assertions),
  and the unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run passed all 34 suites exactly once with zero
  failures/timeouts (summary SHA-256 `0bbff288638a3ca5a509fa158a398b59d1bb4b45c10f63150452cfaa92fa15e2`,
  hard-kill 317/0); build (7/15/7), secret scan, parse gate (156 files), diff checks, and sync DryRun
  passed. Step 1 is complete (Task 1 1/6, Phase 2 1/52). Production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 sealed under-lock capability preflight (2026-08-29, additive building block): the
  registry surface gained `Invoke-SealedHeldCapabilityPreflight` with CLR-sealed evidence types. It
  requires the genuine global-lock witness (optional canonical witness revalidated in order), accepts
  only an approved external non-reparse probe root disjoint from the authority area and targets, fails
  closed on pre-existing probe residue without modifying it, binds metadata VolumeId to the live
  volume serial, and runs the real write-capability probe per target under the held locks. Evidence
  rows are immutable and a supplied expected hash must reproduce the under-lock probe exactly; the
  tests prove the plan-bound recovery-root claim hash reproduces under the held locks, with zero
  authority-area writes and zero residue from the invocation's exact owned probe slots. The preflight
  never wildcard-cleans matching entries: foreign residue created after the initial check is
  preserved and makes the post-probe check fail closed. Lock/contract rejections and ETS forgery
  resistance remain covered. No pinned script changed and no production route consumes the
  preflight yet;
  Step 2's resolver-side wiring and setup-Apply bootstrap flow remain open. Focused
  `root-claims-registry.tests.ps1` reached 218 PASS with exit code 0. The unified `run-tests.ps1
  -All` run passed all 34 suites exactly once with zero failures/timeouts (summary SHA-256
  `51f51e8b0eba5421979b712cb586826bc392ce90251b97ea8e114e0c82a0e8c4`, hard-kill 317/0); parse gate
  (156 files), build (7/15/7), secret scan, diff checks, and sync DryRun passed. Task 1 remains 1/6
  and Phase 2 remains 1/52. Production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 per-target/per-volume capability and exact-slot hardening (2026-08-29, additive
  building block): the preflight now accepts an exact target-to-ProbeRoot map and seals each root's
  path, location key, and captured identity into its target row. It validates the complete map before
  the first probe, including target/target, target/root, root/root, and authority overlap plus exact
  target/root volume equality. Canonical LocationKey ordering makes evidence permutation-stable. A
  dynamic two-Fixed/NTFS-volume branch executed on the current validation host and proved correct
  per-volume routing, both wrong-volume zero-probe rejections, zero authority/external drift, and
  empty probe roots. The lower probe holds the full ProbeRoot containment chain, binds the expected
  root identity, rejects matching residue case-insensitively before and after probing, and uses a
  create-new, no-delete-share held GUID slot. Exact-slot creation rollback/deletion requires the same
  identity, directory type, single-link state, no alternate streams, and emptiness; child cleanup is
  identity-bound under that held slot. Foreign entries and bytes are preserved, with no
  wildcard/recursive/path-delete fallback. Pinned-source and
  dependent hard-kill hashes are recomputed from the final reviewed bytes. No production route
  consumes this evidence; Task 1 remains 1/6 and Phase 2 remains 1/52, with production Apply still
  interlocked. Final validation on 2026-08-30 passed the 156-file parse gate, artifact validation
  (21 contracts, 21 positive fixtures, 66 negative fixtures), and all 34 unified suites exactly once
  with zero failure/timeout/discovery/process-tree anomalies; the external summary SHA-256 is
  `7e4d1c855804a4db29d9ca4175fa1bb7c9113bfc1b238564cd3ce19ec6a0e0bf`, with hard-kill 317/0.
  Final build (7/15/7), pinned gitleaks (no blocking findings; 828 reviewed hints), diff checks, and
  sync DryRun also passed; the DryRun preserved `.system` and changed no live file.

- Phase 2 Task 1 fixed-infrastructure same-lock capability capture (2026-08-30, additive Step 2
  checkpoint): the new internal `Invoke-SealedHeldFixedInfrastructureCapabilityCapture` accepts
  exactly the `ControlBase` and `BackupRoot` roles, derives both target paths only from the sealed
  authority context, holds one outer fixed-envelope lease across both real per-target probes, and
  returns CLR-sealed `FIXED_INFRASTRUCTURE_PROBED` evidence only after exact final global-lock,
  optional canonical-binding, fixed-envelope, identity, security, volume, filesystem, and role-map
  revalidation. A private-token exact issuer pins the reviewed raw-preflight and lower-probe
  ScriptBlocks so command shadows and public-factory evidence cannot substitute for the real probes;
  an independently tested validator rejects forged/reprojected or self-consistently drifted raw
  evidence. Primary and cleanup failures retain their separate evidence, including outer-envelope
  cleanup Data. Recursive production-seam guards prove zero production consumer and freeze dynamic,
  member/property, reflection, `using`, type-definition, `Add-Type`, and member-dispatch bypass
  surfaces; AppDomain/string, case-variant, and short-type/property-only reflection mutations all
  fail closed. Focused root-claims and 29/0 seam suites, modified-file parsing, and diff checks passed.
  Closure validation also hardened two tests-only bounds: legacy Job reap now uses one reviewed
  30-second absolute deadline and primary-first cleanup. At that checkpoint its dedicated semantics
  suite had a 60-second runner bound, the expanded root-claims suite had a 600-second bound, and the
  Windows workflow used 276 minutes. The 16335-second computed requirement remained below the
  16560-second job limit with a 225-second outer difference. These historical budget values are
  superseded by the 2026-09-01 correction below. The 34/34 create-new unified
  summary predates only this final budget-only adjustment; afterward reap semantics passed 27/0 and
  the runner contract passed with the 60-second/276-minute delta. That unified summary passed 34/34
  with every failure counter zero
  (SHA-256 `fdf669636415e10f7f9e76b9f404ced705e02eb9225b6a89f1060205d4462784`); hard-kill reached 317/0,
  reap semantics 27/0, and the root-claims suite completed in 306091 ms. The 156-file parse gate,
  artifact matrix 21/21/66, build 7/15/7, pinned secret scan with zero blocking findings, diff checks,
  and sync DryRun then passed; `.system` was preserved and no live file changed. The wide
  reflection/member digest intentionally requires review for future production dispatch changes. No
  production Apply/rollback/current-route consumer uses this evidence; process-static
  first-ScriptBlock/runspace lifetime and evidence temporal scope remain integration blockers.
  Task 1 remains 1/6 and Phase 2 remains 1/52, with production Apply interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 receiver-backed held-route capability observation (2026-08-31, commit `4af1d79`,
  narrow Step 2 checkpoint): a caller-owned sealed receiver now accepts exact ownership transfer for
  safe containment chains, target/live leases, current-route capture, and the runtime observation.
  The observation borrows the genuine held route, canonical witness, and global lock, owns frozen
  outer fixed-envelope handle chains, and reports exactly
  `Coverage=HELD_CURRENT_ROUTE_FIXED_INFRASTRUCTURE_PROBED`, `Scope=RUNTIME_ONLY`, and
  `MutationAuthorization=NONE`. Its public `Open`/`Assert`/`Close` lifecycle APIs have zero production
  callers. The only production consumer of the current-route capture remains the read-only registry,
  whose output is still `HELD_METADATA_VERIFIED` / `UNPROBED_READ_ONLY`; no resolver, dispatcher,
  setup, Apply, rollback, or live-mutation path consumes the observation.

  The fixed-capability issuer moved from process-first ScriptBlock capture to per-runspace definitions
  weak-keyed by `Runspace`, with exact pinned ScriptBlock references, runspace identity, and a
  definition-local issuer token. Real `PowerShell.Stop` coverage pins the route's exact
  `DeliverExact`-to-transfer-flag boundary, proves observation receiver durability after public
  `Open` returns, and verifies the delivered safe-chain/target resources remain open for explicit
  cleanup. It does not claim an internal observation `DeliverExact`-to-flag breakpoint, cover legacy
  raw success-stream return branches, or make the complete public API Stop-safe. Remaining debt includes legacy raw returns (safe-existing,
  retained traversal, target, and live-set included); runspace-disposal recovery and observation
  definitions retaining strong runspace references; target/live `Assert` versus concurrent `Close`;
  transitive provider closure and raw-getter capability transfer; computed provider-path dataflow and
  a literal-provider-token static false positive; opaque bare lease wrappers; and a durable recovery
  ticket when route cleanup itself fails. Step 2 remains incomplete; Task 1 stays 1/6, Phase 2 stays
  1/52, and production Apply remains interlocked.

  Validation follow-up on 2026-09-01 proved two budget defects rather than hangs. The production-seam
  suite completed standalone in about 166.9 seconds and then passed 56/0 under the real runner in
  193092 ms with a 240-second bound. The observation lifecycle added about nine real `Open` paths
  plus route captures; the root-claims suite then passed under the real runner with 438 PASS lines and
  exit code 0 in 1291927 ms with an 1800-second bound. The first unified
  run completed 31 suites successfully, rejected one stale hard-kill reviewed baseline, and cleanly
  tree-reaped only those two under-budget suites. Seventeen directly or transitively affected
  reviewed constants were recomputed against the committed production bytes; the reviewed load set
  and 67-function/131-edge static production closure remained unchanged. The new
  suite-budget sum is 17235 seconds, the computed job requirement is 17655 seconds, and the Windows
  workflow is 298 minutes / 17880 seconds, retaining the prior 225-second outer difference. Focused
  validation passed hard-kill primitives 95/0, complete hard-kill 317/0, the runner budget contract,
  and both real-runner timeout checks. The final unified result is recorded in the recovery-stage
  follow-up below. This changes only tests and CI bounds and grants no production mutation authority.

- Test-internal recovery-stage publication-race follow-up (2026-09-01, commit `b1fe6e1`): a
  subsequent create-new validation attempt completed all 34 discovered and started suites with 33
  passing, one failing, and zero timeouts (summary SHA-256
  `88b4cfd0cfb911600c3a1fbf76c7c82e362f8ffaebeaa930c6826372d9445342`). The only failing suite was
  hard-kill at 233/5: its tests-only reader opened a publisher-private temp through `ReadAllText`,
  blocked `File.Move`, and caused four later failures to cascade. The reader now classifies the
  complete enumerated name set first, reports an exact temp as stable publication-in-progress, gives
  unknown names precedence, and reads content only from validated final names. Exclusive-open probes
  pin this behavior deterministically.

  The repair changes only the seven required transitive reviewed baselines; final hard-kill file
  SHA-256 is `2e3dae688d2334fe171558adfee00b68ba5e2778a5f6ae70a1a1637cf9e5c234`.
  Primitives passed 95/0, the original failing focused case set passed 22/0, the complete hard-kill
  suite passed 318/0, and read-only logic/baseline audits found no P0, P1, or P2 issue. This is not
  held-identity or atomic-directory-snapshot evidence: final replacement, StageRoot rebinding, and
  external scanners remain open boundaries. The final create-new unified run discovered, started,
  completed, and passed all 34 suites exactly once, with zero failures, timeouts, duplicates, missing
  suites, or tree-kill failures. Its external summary SHA-256 is
  `976f84e50aadc0ac37fb89acee183961d01c6f5fdf9a5ff99fda11424b72c5a8`; the embedded hard-kill
  record exited 0 and passed 318/0.

  Final post-run gates passed the 156-file PowerShell syntax check, registered artifact validation
  at 21 contracts / 21 positive / 66 negative / 0 failures (summary SHA-256
  `b87d5c65bc3e1f1bee8375b54acb023edf9cdb8b515da3251ca3e6ce412af0cf`), the 7/15/7
  Claude/Codex/Reasonix skill build, and the pinned secret scan with zero blocking findings. A sync
  DryRun used a fresh external path whose plan leaf was absent before invocation, changed no live
  files, and produced PlanHash
  `b94ca90b872568bddeed048a959b37b40f0cd8f1d89c90936afa876a32783e2e` with plan-file SHA-256
  `4c5ccb35185531f5da8a052371bef4a3f76a741571056536ea22a2e92a236d08`. No Apply was run. Task 1
  remains 1/6, Phase 2 remains 1/52, and production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 observation issuer per-runscape definition migration (2026-09-01): the observation
  issuer's pinned definitions moved from a process-static `Dictionary<string,...>` keyed by
  normalized runscape-id strings to the reviewed per-runscape `ConditionalWeakTable<Runspace,...>`
  pattern with an `OwnerRunspaceId` Guid binding, matching the route-capture and fixed-capability
  issuers. Definition resolution now goes through the live current-runscape object, its instance id,
  and the owner binding; `InitializeObservationExact` validates the supplied runscape id against the
  actual current runscape. Fail-closed contracts are unchanged (cross-runscape, same-text
  substitution, clone/uninitialized rejection); the issuer public surface and every PowerShell-level
  function are byte-identical. The focused root-claims suite reached 442 PASS with exit code 0
  (438 before), pinning the storage type, the owner binding, and child-runscape recovery (a fresh
  runscape initializes its own equal-digest definition bound to itself). An out-of-repository probe
  recorded the honest boundary that forced GC after child-runscape disposal did not evict the
  existing route-capture CWT entry (the pinned ScriptBlock/session-state chain keeps the owner
  runscape reachable), so this slice claims per-runscape scoping and recovery, not collection
  guarantees. Validation: seams 56/0 after one re-pin (reflection-sensitive count 12660 unchanged;
  digest `aea11a7f…` → `343ec71636bbd1b91f0d4989d271559badb5cf28ac88bad149894a3ebac0dfcc` because
  the C# here-string edit shifts site positions), parse gate 156 files, build 7/15/7, secret scan
  clean (835 hints), `git diff --check`, and a sync DryRun with a fresh external plan path (29
  additions, zero modified/removed/unknown, `.system` preserved, no live change; plan-file SHA-256
  `44ef6692064762be975310d9a73864532e828214ba101ee08322af666a00ac54`, deleted after the run). The
  definitive unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run then passed all 34 discovered suites exactly once with
  zero failures, timeouts, duplicates, missing suites, or tree-kill failures; its external
  create-new summary SHA-256 is
  `2e5fc36a843481532af00606a3cb98f31e908e702b4ea1ceb309ccd6c15867dd`, with hard-kill 318/0, seams
  56/0, and root-claims 442/0 inside the run. Task 1 remains 1/6
  and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 observation caller/cleanup ledger (2026-09-01): the Step 2 named deliverable is
  production-defined as an additive sealed building block. `scripts/root-claims-registry-common.ps1`
  gains the CLR `SealedHeldObservationCleanupLedger`, five issuer lifecycle statics, and five
  reviewed facade functions (`Open-SealedHeldObservationCleanupLedger`,
  `Register-SealedHeldObservationCleanupLedgerObservation`, `Assert-SealedHeldObservationCleanupLedger`,
  `Close-SealedHeldObservationCleanupLedgerObservation`, `Close-SealedHeldObservationCleanupLedger`).
  The ledger binds to its owner runscape's live issuer definition (provenance token, definition
  digest, runscape instance id), registers only genuine receipt-bound OPEN observations as single-use
  entries, refuses ledger close while any entry is OPEN, releases each entry's observation through
  the exact reviewed `CloseObservationExact` route before committing the entry, and closes
  single-use and idempotently. Cross-runscape and clone provenance attacks fail closed. The
  observation's public Open/Assert/Close APIs retain zero production callers (the ledger closes
  through the issuer internal static route); the ledger itself has zero production consumers and
  grants no mutation authority. Focused root-claims passed 480 assertions with exit code 0 (442
  before; the issuer surface freeze now pins the ten reviewed statics and the selector enumeration
  covers the five new functions), and seams passed 56/0 after deliberate re-pin (five new invocation
  rows, five owner-binding rows, reflection count 12660 → 12682, digest →
  `374b019e0e591b913d647e99d0f6c765bceb14aebe4fb77ecdcbb016819a4dd8`, dynamic-command digest
  unchanged). Gates: parse 156 files, build 7/15/7, secret scan clean (837 hints), `git diff
  --check`, sync DryRun with a fresh external plan path (no live change; plan-file SHA-256
  `f880cf5f6778e45ec397f043d411ec152b4c457bf8700b4693afca5e67744c82`, deleted after the run). The
  definitive unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run then passed all 34 discovered suites exactly once with
  zero failures, timeouts, duplicates, missing suites, or tree-kill failures; its external
  create-new summary SHA-256 is
  `3e2274593188ed79fde14be647410093e0606246302ff12aa51ff902c7252512`, with hard-kill 318/0, seams
  56/0, and root-claims 480/0 inside the run. Task 1 remains 1/6
  and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 live-set receiver-backing (2026-09-01): the live-set member of the
  receiver/raw-return blocker is closed. `Open-SealedHeldLiveTargetContextSet` now requires a
  caller-owned `SealedOwnershipTransferReceiver` and delivers only through exact ownership transfer;
  the raw success-stream return branch is removed. Production was already receiver-based (the
  pinned route-capture live-set open core passes the receiver and asserts zero output), and the
  open-failure cleanup path — including a `PipelineStoppedException` before delivery — is
  unchanged. The three raw-branch test call sites converted to receiver style (the pipeline-retention
  probe now proves receiver durability), and new assertions pin the exact four-parameter
  mandatory-receiver contract and reject receiver-less invocation. Focused root-claims passed 482
  assertions with exit code 0 (480 before); seams passed 56/0 without baseline change (no
  inventoried member, type, or literal text changed). Gates: parse 156 files, build 7/15/7, secret
  scan clean (841 hints), `git diff --check`, sync DryRun with a fresh external plan path (no live
  change; plan-file SHA-256
  `dda9dcff69c1b6da4575f020c05ab6549105fb5003e454680198e685ddef08ab`, deleted after the run). The
  definitive unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run then passed all 34 discovered suites exactly once with
  zero failures, timeouts, duplicates, missing suites, or tree-kill failures; its external
  create-new summary SHA-256 is
  `57066efaac18f9a8b849eee852a6fc58721c7f90b1f31c2fc0ed0136229a634f`, with hard-kill 318/0, seams
  56/0, and root-claims 482/0 inside the run. Task 1 remains 1/6
  and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 target-lease receiver-backing (2026-09-02): the target-lease member of the
  receiver/raw-return blocker is closed. `Open-SealedHeldTargetContextLease` now requires a
  caller-owned receiver and delivers only through exact ownership transfer; the raw success-stream
  return branch is removed. Production was already receiver-based, and the open-failure cleanup
  path — including `PipelineStoppedException` before delivery — is unchanged. Because
  `target-context-common.ps1` is hard-kill-sealed, the full reviewed-load re-pin was performed to a
  fixpoint with an out-of-repository probe: manifest hash `d777c1c4…` →
  `a3a585b0f957f943d9a36959e304247abc8a9208c6799885cac9b3dd548d348c` (both sites), the 24-row
  actual-prelude block and digest (now
  `77d3145dbb8df1bcdf17e90c809ff34798e40803f9206ca6af1c5930dca3cf81`, four occurrences), the
  27-statement pre-section region digest (`0317b628…`), the transport-contract and mutations
  function pins, function-inventory, cleanup-gate self, main-try execution, top-level execution, and
  the whole-file controller surface digest. Final hard-kill file SHA-256
  `27da95165a92b253fea5714111cd680e8e46865f46e0d363ddccf2f7a25bda63`. The probe confirmed the
  documented hyphen leak in the historical function-pin regex (`[A-Za-z0-9]+` misses hyphenated
  names) and re-pinned through the corrected `[A-Za-z0-9-]+` loop; no suite assertion was weakened.
  All six raw-branch test call sites converted to receiver style with post-state semantics
  preserved; two new assertions pin the mandatory-receiver contract and reject receiver-less
  invocation. Validation: complete standalone hard-kill 318/0 (primitives 95/0 fast signal),
  path-safety PASS, focused root-claims 484 assertions exit 0 (482 before), seams 56/0 without
  baseline change, parse gate 156 files, build 7/15/7, secret scan clean (843 hints),
  `git diff --check`, sync DryRun with a fresh external plan path (no live change; plan-file SHA-256
  `2f89fafb31f933301d26c70c40c9161e9898581cc461e3ba566b07eae1bdc759`, deleted after the run). The
  definitive unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run for this slice is still pending. Task 1 remains 1/6
  and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 safe-existing containment receiver-backing (2026-09-02): the safe-existing member
  of the receiver/raw-return blocker is closed.
  `Open-SafeExistingDirectoryContainmentChain` now requires a caller-owned receiver and delivers the
  held handle chain through exact ownership transfer only; the raw `return ,$handles` branch is
  removed. All six production call sites converted to the two-line receiver pattern across
  `safe-tree-walker.ps1` (entry-marker lookup, create-new copy path), `approved-runner-common.ps1`,
  `canonical-mutation-common.ps1`, and `transaction-journal-common.ps1` (journal-parent,
  worktree-root); `GetDeliveredExact` returns the identical list instance, so indexing, close, and
  finally semantics are unchanged. The three hard-kill-sealed scripts required the full reviewed-load
  re-pin to a fixpoint via the generalized N-manifest probe (manifest hashes `safe-tree-walker` →
  `0c902469…`, `canonical-mutation-common` → `70ee83e0…`, `transaction-journal-common` →
  `77594bf5…`, both sites each; prelude block+digest `ce6416f2…`; pre-section `dba2c033…`; function
  pins; inventory; self; main-try; top-execution; surface). Final hard-kill file SHA-256
  `4766228f652c99aa0728ba4e02913b43ca4775eb0644505d57260cbd5091c9ae`. The production closure
  contract (67/131/`b15898c8…`) passed unchanged, confirming boundary-function body edits stay
  outside the closure digest. Validation: primitives 95/0, full hard-kill 318/0, approved-runner,
  mutation-blockers, transaction-journal-exact-byte, and path-safety all PASS, seams 56/0 after one
  reflection re-pin (count 12682 → 12694, digest `77ec47b4…`), parse gate 156 files, build 7/15/7,
  secret scan clean (845 hints), diff-check, sync DryRun without live change (plan-file SHA-256

  unified run started for `48a30ae` was killed externally at suite 5/34 with no published result
  (session-restore process loss), so one definitive unified run executes after this commit covering
  both `48a30ae` and this slice; every affected suite has passed standalone. The definitive combined
  create-new unified run then passed all 34 discovered suites exactly once with zero failures,
  timeouts, duplicates, missing suites, or tree-kill failures (external summary SHA-256
  `20b522730ef2e034d3f9467ea9023d450999ba1b7baad71d523885813304753f`), with hard-kill 318/0, seams
  56/0, root-claims 484/0, approved-runner 45/0, and transaction-journal-exact-byte 12/0 inside the
  run. Task 1 remains 1/6 and
  Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 plain containment-chain receiver-backing (2026-09-02): the largest member of the
  receiver/raw-return blocker is closed. `Open-SafeDirectoryContainmentChain` now requires a
  caller-owned receiver and delivers only through exact ownership transfer; the raw return branch is
  removed. All thirty production call sites across nine scripts and the real test call sites across
  eleven files (including the hard-kill `HardKillBehaviorAcquire` delegate scriptblock and its
  fingerprint pin, and the sealed canonical-hard-kill-host helper) converted to the two-line
  receiver pattern with identical downstream semantics. The re-pin surfaced two new self-seal pin
  classes — the two pre-section section-owner IF-statement token hashes (primitives owner →
  `a5c1391c…`) and the preimage provenance `allowedMembers` whitelist now admitting the reviewed
  `GetDeliveredExact` — beyond the established ten. Final hard-kill file SHA-256
  `cb2cc1cf4e0e5ab887bd4795b901a63ab9fd813398f2010af972f811000db40a`; closure contract 67/131/
  `b15898c8…` unchanged. Validation: primitives 95/0, full hard-kill 318/0, nine affected suites
  PASS, seams 56/0 after one reflection re-pin (count 12694 → 12756, digest `7679a8a5…`), parse 156
  files, build 7/15/7, secret scan clean (847 hints), diff-check, sync DryRun without live change

  `25aa688305faeb4119c00bfd92626f1b1bc3e1c676611ff4caa8a234e1ac2a67`, deleted after the run). The
  definitive unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run then passed all 34 discovered suites exactly once with

  seams 56/0, root-claims 484/0, and home-authority 190/0 inside the run. With this slice the
  safe-existing, target-lease, live-set, and plain containment-chain raw-return branches are all
  receiver-backed; only the retained-traversal composite remains open. Task 1 remains 1/6 and Phase
  2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 retained-traversal receiver-backing (2026-09-02): the last raw success-stream
  branch in the sealed registry's resource chain is closed. `safe-tree-walker.ps1` gains the sealed
  wrapper `Open-SafeTreeRetainedTraversal` (mandatory caller-owned receiver, exact ownership
  transfer of the snapshot-plus-retained-handles composite, failure cleanup in finally), and all
  three production consumers (`Copy-SafeTree`, `New-CommittedDataSnapshot`,
  `Get-CanonicalRetainedDirectoryObservation`) open through its receiver; the raw
  `Get-SafeTreeSnapshotInternal -RetainContainmentHandles` path is no longer production-reachable.
  Hard-kill re-pin: manifest hashes (`canonical-mutation-common` → `9b77a0a3…`,
  `safe-tree-walker` → `e040c417…`), the self-seal fixpoint, and the production-closure contract
  whose referenced boundary set changed by exactly one member — `Get-SafeTreeSnapshotInternal`
  dropped out (its only closure-reachable caller now routes through the wrapper) while
  `Open-SafeTreeRetainedTraversal` entered with the identical `ShouldSkipEntry` ParameterAst digest
  `c341358e…`; 67/131/13 counts unchanged, closure digest now
  `a719c9cb940a98e091941ef079e317f0f28b6e4f66d7a9f513b5232933ab2d9c` (contract baseline and
  cleanup-gate assertion), verified first by an out-of-repository closure diagnostic. Final
  hard-kill file SHA-256
  `45c88d9fedf7a61ad0fe410f851b2bd03207176766d4a40c0ccdbb0b5c29bfc9`. The mutation-blockers static
  assertion now requires the retained-observation route through the wrapper with no direct
  `RetainContainmentHandles` reference; seams re-pinned deliberately (closure + exception inventory
  rows with `ScriptBlockParameter` digest `ad9aa49e…`, reflection count 12756 → 12768, digest
  `7c88fdec06bd95d47c49a8f9a30e6977caad3230b1ab8c465cb3f46570860437`) and passed 56/0.
  Validation: primitives 95/0 after the closure-baseline fix, complete hard-kill 318/0,

  definitive unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run then passed all 34 discovered suites exactly once with
  zero failures, timeouts, duplicates, missing suites, or tree-kill failures; its external

  `d9fab280ff76df72b8b1507e96378583e9abce5671678c718834037c5b5a0f39`, with hard-kill 318/0, seams
  56/0, root-claims 484/0, mutation-blockers 32/0, recovery 104/0, and skills-import 42/0 inside
  the run. With this slice all
  receiver/raw-return branches in the sealed registry's resource chain are receiver-backed. Task 1
  remains 1/6 and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 target/live reader-close blocking (2026-09-02): both held receipt classes
  (target-lease and live-set) gained a lifecycle gate with an active-reader counter and public
  `BeginReadExact`/`EndReadExact`; both `Assert` functions hold the read for their whole
  revalidation, and both release paths restore `OPEN` and throw `target-context-close-active` when
  a reader is active. Closed receipts refuse new readers; unbalanced releases fail closed; close
  remains single-use and idempotent; the live-set cascade reaches its three nested leases only
  after the set-level reader releases. `target-context-common.ps1` required the manifest re-pin
  plus the self-seal fixpoint (final hard-kill file SHA-256
  `34f244cb0e84a27aa44e2fe764c0fcc706478a35bdf260a860cee37fa031c329`; target-context-common
  `5fc1433e7187aa9a3da0efbf7301f8ace4e2a42cccdebe2ab1dda8ba4eb973d5`); `live-target-context.ps1`
  is not hard-kill-sealed. Tests: target and live lifecycle blocks plus a real-concurrency
  orchestration (child-runscape `Assert` blocked on its first evidence re-read; the main runscape's
  concurrent close is rejected `target-context-close-active` with the lease OPEN; after release the
  assert completes and the caller closes) — focused root-claims reached 498 PASS with exit code 0
  (484 before). Seams re-pinned only the reflection inventory (12768 → 12772, digest
  `7f867f39…`) and passed 56/0. Validation: primitives 95/0, complete hard-kill 318/0, parse 156

  and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 raw-getter capability stripping (2026-09-02): the closure survey confirmed every
  transitive-close path in the observation chain is already complete and located the real exposure
  in the facade getters that handed out the route-capture-owned live-set wrapper and receipt.
  `GetLiveSetLeaseExact`/`GetLiveSetReceiptExact` keep their reviewed names and now return the
  capability-stripped `SealedHeldLiveSetBorrowedStateProjection` (CloseState, IsClosed,
  TargetLeaseCloseStates) built through a private cross-assembly exact-reflection helper; the two
  production identity checks read the new internal field accessors; `GetCurrentRouteCaptureExact`
  and the caller-owned getters stay raw by design. The 27-name facade freeze is untouched. Tests:
  both projections reflect the open live set, the projection cannot close the borrowed set
  (receipt-missing stale), and the receipt projection exposes no nested leases — focused
  root-claims 501 PASS exit 0 (498 before). Seams re-pinned only the reflection digest (count
  12772 unchanged, `192eefa2…`) and passed 56/0; no edited file is hard-kill-sealed. Gates: parse

  definitive unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run then passed all 34 discovered suites exactly once with

  56/0, and root-claims 501/0 inside the run. Task 1 remains 1/6
  and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Provider-token debt closure assessment (2026-09-02): the "computed provider-path dataflow and a
  literal-provider-token static false positive" sub-debt is already covered by shipped work — the
  seams suite scans literal `Alias:`/`Function:` drive tokens and drive-qualified variable forms
  with mutation-RED acceptance tests, declares computed-path data flow out of scope as a deliberate
  design boundary, and reports zero false positives at 56/0. No code change was needed. The
  remaining open Step 2 sub-debts are the opaque bare lease wrappers, the durable recovery ticket
  when route cleanup itself fails, and wiring the cleanup ledger as the reviewed observation
  lifecycle owner.

- Phase 2 Task 1 bare-lease wrapper de-mirroring (2026-09-02): the mutable `IsClosed` NoteProperty
  is removed from both target-lease and live-set wrappers (constructor line and post-close mirror
  block), after a reader census proved zero production or test readers of that property on those
  wrappers — the bound receipt CWT is now the single close-state truth for every route-capture
  collection wrapper, eliminating the drift/forge channel. The fixed-envelope lease's own
  authoritative `IsClosed` (no receipt there) is deliberately untouched as a separate follow-up. A
  new assertion pins the absence of the display on a closed wrapper. Hard-kill manifest re-pin plus
  the self-seal fixpoint (final hard-kill file SHA-256
  `4c84e4a89f9a11b40338e50743a0e42a1824fca61bc822573d8d053d5923320e`); seams reflection inventory

  56/0, root-claims 502/0, and path-safety 43/0 inside the run. Task 1 remains 1/6
  and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 envelope close-state CWT-ization (2026-09-02): the fixed-envelope lease's
  authoritative close state moved into the new `SealedHomeAuthorityFixedEnvelopeCloseState`
  conditional-weak-table class (volatile-backed reads; unbound objects read open, mark no-op),
  replacing the spoofable `IsClosed` NoteProperty at both construction sites, the raw close
  idempotence gate and write, the projection invalidation check, the observation owned-close and
  force-close paths, and the open-path validation. An independent Grok review caught a P0 layering
  defect pre-commit (the class initially lived above the standalone-dot-sourced HA layer); it moved
  into `home-authority-common.ps1`'s own guarded `Add-Type` with the observation side reaching it
  through cross-assembly exact reflection, and the review's P2s were adopted (volatile reads,
  early `BindExact` before the initial projection, two anti-forgery assertions). The pinned issuer
  snapshot ScriptBlocks keep the old shape by design (digest identity pins, never dispatched).
  Validation: home-authority PASS, live-concurrency PASS, root-claims 504 assertions exit 0 (502
  before), seams 56/0 after baseline re-pin (12753 → 12755, `41c54b74…`), complete hard-kill 318/0,

  and Phase 2 remains 1/52; production Apply remains interlocked.

- Execution state (2026-09-02, parallel batch): staging locks rebuilt fresh (three environments
  built+valid against current HEAD, harness-env regression 126/0, working tree clean, no interlock
  impact). External design batch under the Grok/Luna/main-agent routing rule produced the durable
  recovery ticket design, the ledger-wiring owner-trio design, and the ticket test-block draft;
  the main-agent correction requires `route-cleanup-recovery` to join the envelope
  `ControlBase` children whitelist in the same commit as ticket publication. Remaining queue:
  slice 1 (ticket), slice A (wiring), slice B (failure matrix), then the resolver consumer layer,
  `PrivateRootBootstrapIntent`, protocol-v1 dispatch, and the forbidden-root matrix.

- Phase 2 Task 1 slice 1, durable recovery ticket (2026-09-02): `ReleaseExact` failures now publish
  `<ControlBase>\route-cleanup-recovery\<CaptureId>\ticket.json` atomically (immutable descriptor
  snapshotted before the first release, per-lease attempt/close states, ContentHash, seven
  `DurableRecoveryTicket*` Data keys, publish errors never shadowing the primary), with read-only
  discovery and the envelope `ControlBase` children check moved to allow-list + required-set form
  (sidecar optional, original four required) plus the matching bootstrap-snapshot extra. Discovery
  is discoverability only; interpretation/consumption/retry stay with Task 4. An independent
  full-access Grok review found and fixed a real production defect in the new discovery facade
  (boolean-to-string cast made every valid ticket skipped) and verified the focused suite. A
  read-only Grok pre-commit review raised three defects, all adopted: the identity-collision branch
  was fail-open (now a per-field needle match over every immutable identity field, mismatch failing
  closed), the recovery descriptor was snapshotted after the closing CAS (now before the CAS, a
  snapshot failure leaving the capture OPEN), and the rename-hold gate had no timeout (now 60 s,
  then best-effort temp deletion and a `failed` publish). Validation: focused root-claims 529 PASS
  exit 0 re-verified after the fixes (504 before), complete hard-kill 318/0, home-authority PASS,
  path-safety PASS, seams 56/0 after reflection re-pin (12755 \u2192 12773, digest after the fixes

- Phase 2 Task 1 slice A, ledger wiring (2026-09-03): the cleanup ledger is wired as the reviewed
  observation lifecycle owner via the new `Open-/Assert-/Close-SealedHeldObservationLifecycle`
  trio — dual caller receivers, private-receiver open/register/dual-assert before delivery, a
  complete failure matrix (registered observations close through the ledger entry route;
  unregistered ones through exactly one issuer `CloseObservationExact`; empty or entry-settled
  ledgers close; cleanup errors ride `SealedHeldObservationLifecycleCleanupError`), and — per the
  pre-commit review — unconditional ledger closure once the entry obligation is settled so a
  half-delivery can no longer leak an OPEN ledger to the caller. The observation `Close-` facade
  keeps zero production callers; the observation `Open-/Assert-` facades and the five ledger
  facades have exactly one reviewed production caller each, enforced by the rewritten seams
  boundary (per-facade allowed-caller inventories, owner inventory assertions, trio unique
  definitions, issuer invocation +1, owner-binding digest
  `451449d7df35a1950c099aa0da20dc18aeaf9258666ae93ead06900e7795df17`). `MutationAuthorization=NONE`

  `d8f6ef0e1bf3d359214db79c0844f806bff71bd89f2284a052b7c44818517189`, with hard-kill 318/0, seams
  56/0, and root-claims 546/0 inside the run. Task 1 remains 1/6 and Phase 2 remains 1/52;
  production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task 1 slice B, lifecycle owner failure matrix (2026-09-03): five failure paths pinned as
  suite-style regressions (the Luna Pester-style draft rewritten against the trio's actual
  interface): register failure delivers nothing and propagates; assert failure surfaces as the
  observation stale error while ledger/entry/observation stay OPEN and retryable; entry-close
  failure restores the observation OPEN, keeps entry and ledger OPEN, propagates, and refuses the
  ledger close; no `LiveTransactionsRoot` children and no `SealedRegistryRouteCleanupError` Data key
  on entry-close failure. Focused root-claims 556 PASS exit 0 (546 before). No production file
  changed; seams 56/0 unchanged; parse 156 files, build 7/15/7, secret scan clean (872 hints),
  diff-check, sync DryRun without live change (plan-file SHA-256
  `22fc7c597f1984801997cbcef2e0099e6325e03554b5ef6404da8152d36a49c1`, deleted after the run). The
  definitive unified `run-tests.ps1 -All` run then passed all 34 discovered suites exactly once with
  zero failures, timeouts, duplicates, missing suites, or tree-kill failures; its external
  create-new summary SHA-256 is
  `a7040d09f35de17d56911e4fedff4bd8d83dfee95826ea3312ba58d4e6893aae`, with hard-kill 318/0, seams
  56/0, and root-claims 556/0 inside the run. Task 1 remains 1/6 and Phase 2 remains 1/52;
  production Apply remains interlocked.

- Resolver-prereq survey (2026-09-03, Luna + main-agent): `PrivateRootBootstrapIntent` carries two
  shipped layers — the canonical plan's reduced intent (schema + implementation complete) and the
  sealed home-authority full intent (implementation complete, test-adapter-driven) — with no
  production adapter between them. Seven gaps to resolver-consumer wiring documented (production
  context-to-full-intent conversion, hash binding across layers, lock-internal recapture, ordered
  sequence, trio as sole caller, ticket boundary, protocol-v1/forbidden-root gates). Next
  implementable sub-slice: production `AuthorityContext`-to-full-intent conversion replacing the
  adapter-only restriction.

- Task-2 close-out (2026-09-03): working tree clean at `f25513d`, no code changes this round.
  The 21:34 SetupIntentHash Grok call failed as `grok-exit-code--1` (slow first token + caller
  abandonment, not an outage); session `01a0677a-…14655` verified intact but produced no blueprint
  file — rerun `tmp/grok-setupintent-impl-prompt.txt` after the directory lock clears. Luna's
  PrivateRootBootstrapIntent survey landed (146 lines, conclusions committed in `f25513d`); the
  whitelist coupling is already inside `3228a6b`. Resume order: (1) SetupIntentHash blueprint
  rerun + sub-slice, (2) AuthorityContext-to-full-intent conversion, (3) hash binding, (4)
  resolver consumer layer, (5) `PrivateRootBootstrapIntent`, (6) protocol-v1, (7) forbidden-root
  matrix.

- Phase 2 Task-2 slice 1, SetupIntentHash precompute functions (2026-09-04):
  `scripts/canonical-transaction-common.ps1` gains four pure-computation functions wired into
  `New-CanonicalSetupPlanPayload` with zero behavior change — `Get-CanonicalSetupIntentKeyNames`
  (dictionary-compatible key enumeration), `Assert-CanonicalSetupIntentRootContext` (the schema rootContext oneOf
  state machine, 15-key exact set), `Get-CanonicalSetupIntentHash` (8-key exact intent set plus
  resolver/SID/hash-shape checks), and `Get-CanonicalExpectedSetupStateProjectionHash` (19-key exact projection set
  with the Apply-derived exclusion table checked before the generic unexpected-field check). No new schema file:
  `PrivateRootBootstrapIntent` and the projection shapes are already covered exactly by `$defs/setupPayload` and
  `$defs/setupStateProjection` in `schemas/canonical-transaction-plan.schema.json`.
  `tests/canonical-transaction.tests.ps1` gains the `[setup intent precompute]` block (10 assertions), focused suite
  55/0. The hard-kill reseal plus the seams reflection re-pin (count 12809 → 12828) were verified value-only.
  Validation: hard-kill primitives 95/0, complete hard-kill 318/0, seams 56/0, transaction 55/0, parse gate 156 files,
  build 7/15/7, secret scan clean, `git diff --check` clean, sync DryRun plan hash unchanged. The definitive unified
  `run-tests.ps1 -All` run passed all 34 suites exactly once (external create-new summary SHA-256
  `445ea5d9a937c4162c5da5f9d53c77b456c4386fef2d1a766ac093790c81236c`). Task 1 remains 1/6 and Phase 2 remains 1/52;
  production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task-2 slice 2, production AuthorityContext-to-full-intent conversion (2026-09-04):
  `Assert-SealedHomeAuthorityBootstrapContext` (`scripts/home-authority-common.ps1`) no longer accepts only the
  `sealed-home-authority-test-adapter-v1` context — a production `windows-token-sid-known-folder-v1` context now
  passes an explicit production topology check (canonical SID shape, non-canonical rejection, current-user binding via
  `sealed-home-authority-bootstrap-token-sid-invalid/-noncanonical/-not-current-user`) before joining the same
  path-derivation validation the adapter used; forged resolver versions still fail closed and no new bypass exists
  because the intent payload already binds `IdentityResolverVersion` into `IntentHash`.
  `tests/home-authority.tests.ps1` gains the `[production bootstrap context conversion]` block (7 assertions;
  real-machine LocalAppData ACLs fail the current-user-only template and are asserted as legal fail-closed). Focused
  home-authority passes; live-concurrency passes with zero adapter-path regression; seams reflection inventory
  re-pinned count 12828 → 12833 with digest re-pin, seams 56/0; parse gate 156 files, build 7/15/7, secret scan clean,
  `git diff --check` clean, sync DryRun unchanged. Focused validation recorded; the definitive unified `run-tests.ps1
  -All` run for this state has not been executed or recorded yet. Task 1 remains 1/6 and Phase 2 remains 1/52;
  production Apply remains interlocked.

- Phase 2 Task-2 slice 3, cross-layer intent binding (2026-09-05): `scripts/canonical-transaction-common.ps1` gains
  two pure-computation functions binding the canonical reduced intent (`PlanPayload.PrivateRootBootstrapIntent`) to
  the full sealed intent on the stable quantities plan and claim bind — `Get-CanonicalSealedDirectoryTemplateHash`
  (verifies the sealed template's stored `DirectorySecurityTemplateHash` reproduces the full-template hash, requires
  `ResourceKind='Directory'`, strips `ResourceKind`, hashes the remainder) and
  `Assert-CanonicalSealedSetupIntentBinding` (token-SID binding, template-hash binding, remainder-derived
  control/backup path binding, per-root template-anchor consistency, binding-evidence projection; no FS access, fails
  closed on every tampered quantity). `tests/canonical-transaction.tests.ps1` gains the FS-free `[cross-layer intent
  binding]` block (9 assertions), focused suite 64/0. The `tmp/reseal-txn.ps1` N-manifest probe reached fixpoint in
  three iterations with 13 pin updates (final hard-kill file SHA-256
  `ecfc68a0616a2b6afc1407c0642af277dd877f48415c6c6992d21e3207a33aba`), and the seams reflection-sensitive inventory
  re-pinned count 12833 → 12858 with digest re-pin, seams 56/0. Validation: complete hard-kill 318/0, transaction
  64/0, parse gate 156 files, build PASS, secret scan clean, `git diff --check` clean, sync DryRun identical to the
  established baseline with unchanged PlanHash. Focused validation recorded; the definitive unified `run-tests.ps1
  -All` run for this state has not been executed or recorded yet. Task 1 remains 1/6 and Phase 2 remains 1/52;
  production Apply remains interlocked.

## Current checkpoint

Phase 1 Task 9 and roadmap Task 1 are complete. The branch/tag rewrite is published; Support completed
server-side garbage collection/cache clearing, and the old head is no longer available through the
web, REST, raw-content, or direct Git SHA probes. Ticket `#4697323` and the external privacy follow-up
are closed. The implementation checkpoint now includes the reviewed read-only authority/schema,
sealed fake-ControlBase bootstrap/global-lock, held-lock registry core, caller-held
canonical/current-route slices, the Step 1 identity/concurrency failure matrix, and the sealed
under-lock per-target/per-volume capability preflight with held exact-slot cleanup plus the internal
fixed-infrastructure same-lock capture and receiver-backed held-route runtime observation within Phase
2 Task 1. The observation is production-defined but production-unconsumed; the only production route
consumer remains the read-only registry with `HELD_METADATA_VERIFIED` / `UNPROBED_READ_ONLY` output.
Step 1 is complete (Task 1 1/6); these capability layers advance Step 2 without completing it and
stay unconnected to production mutation routes.

## Current phase

Phase 2 is 0/9 Tasks and 1/52 Steps with Task 1 at 1/6. The production caller/cleanup ledger is
production-defined with zero production consumers, the runspace-lifecycle definition-store blocker
is closed, and every receiver/raw-return branch in the sealed registry's resource chain (target
lease, live set, plain and existing containment chains, retained traversal) is receiver-backed.
The target/live reader-close blocker is closed (both held receipts block concurrent close while
their Assert revalidation holds a read). Next is to close the provider-closure blocker, then wire
the ledger as the reviewed observation lifecycle owner for a resolver or dispatcher consumer. The
`PrivateRootBootstrapIntent` setup path,
protocol-v1 public dispatch, and remaining forbidden-root cases also remain open, including applying
the complete forbidden-root matrix before accepting any default/custom claim. Production Apply
remains disconnected, and live-journal structure and interpretation remain deferred to Task 4.

Pre-lock `MetadataOnly` TargetContext is discovery/planning evidence, never mutation authority.
The sealed read-only registry now recaptures a supplied current route only under the genuine
caller-held lock pair. Future production plan/Apply consumers must hold all required locks, including
the global live lock, then recapture the full no-follow TargetContext and reject any drift before
backup/workspace creation.
The receiver-backed observation can compose that held route with fixed-infrastructure capability
evidence at runtime, but it grants no mutation authority and has no production lifecycle caller. The
sealed bootstrap and read-only registry remain insufficient as a production filesystem-capability
preflight before release.
Pristine bootstrap validation is now separate from the exact fixed post-bootstrap envelope; arbitrary
children remain fail-closed. Canonical-root-claim v1 has no GitCommonDir locator, so the current
canonical namespace and setup state resolve only through the genuine caller-held witness; no
production route supplies it yet. Before Task 4 defines the live-journal contract, any normalized UUID
live-transaction directory is inventoried as unresolved and blocks mutation as recovery-required
rather than being interpreted heuristically.

## Remaining work

Phase 2 has 51 of 52 steps remaining. Task 1 has five remaining steps; Tasks 2-9 are unstarted:

| Task | Remaining steps | Remaining outcome |
|---|---:|---|
| Task 1 | 5/6 | ControlBase/HomeAuthorityKey, registry, shared state, locks, and verification |
| Task 2 | 7/7 | Semantic plan schema 3 and environment-build v3 |
| Task 3 | 7/7 | Unique managed-object and authority-preimage receipts |
| Task 4 | 7/7 | Common live-mutation state machine and journal |
| Task 5 | 6/6 | Normal sync and retirement migration to the common host |
| Task 6 | 5/5 | Crash-recovery status, transitions, failpoints, and restart verification |
| Task 7 | 5/5 | Receipt-backed environment rollback |
| Task 8 | 4/4 | Lock-contention, hard-kill, root-overlap, and custom-target matrix |
| Task 9 | 5/5 | Phase 2 checkpoint and real-home non-mutation proof |

The required execution order is Task 1 -> Task 2 -> Task 3 -> Task 4 -> Task 5 -> Task 6 -> Task 7
-> Task 8 -> Task 9. Phase 3 shared environment authority and task-overlay work, followed by the
Phase 4 schema/CI contract and safe release, have not started. Before future environment planning,
rebuild the stale commit-bound environment staging locks; this does not authorize Apply.

## Safety boundary

Do not run production Apply, backup, rollback, retirement, or live mutation.
`safety-protocol-upgrade-required` remains the expected production result.
